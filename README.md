# Python Magic The Gathering Scraper with Requests and BeautifulSoup
This is a simple script that allows you to scrape the any Magic card info from the offical website https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx.
It's, as I said, quite simple

## How does it work?
It's simple: you run the script and write down the complete name of your card. No need to worry with ponctuation or capitalization of letters as it should deal with these to get an accurate result. 
It's important to input the **full** name of the card because there are many MTG cards that share parts fo there names such as the sinetes of the many guilds in the multiple sets of Ravnica.

## What's next?
In the future I plan to link it with a data base to store the information scraped and make it an executable file.
